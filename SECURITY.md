# Security Considerations

This document outlines security features implemented and known limitations.

## Implemented Security Features

✅ **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage
✅ **Session-based Authentication**: Using express-session with secure cookies in production
✅ **Environment Variable Protection**: SESSION_SECRET must be set in production
✅ **Role-based Access Control**: Middleware enforces proper authorization
✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries throughout

## Known Limitations (For Production Consideration)

⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: Currently not implemented
- **Risk**: API endpoints are vulnerable to DoS attacks
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit)
- **Example**: Limit login attempts, API calls per IP address

⚠️ **CSRF Protection**: Currently not implemented
- **Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks possible
- **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens (e.g., csurf middleware) for state-changing operations
- **Note**: REST APIs often use other authentication methods (JWT, OAuth) instead of sessions to avoid CSRF

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Add Rate Limiting**:
   ```javascript
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   app.use('/api/', limiter);
   ```

2. **Add CSRF Protection** (if continuing to use session-based auth):
   ```javascript
   const csrf = require('csurf');
   app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));
   ```

3. **Consider JWT Authentication** instead of sessions for a REST API:
   - Avoids CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Better for scaling across multiple servers
   - More suitable for mobile/SPA clients

4. **Add Input Validation**:
   - Use validation libraries (e.g., express-validator, joi)
   - Validate all user inputs before processing

5. **Add Request Logging**:
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns

6. **Use HTTPS in Production**:
   - Secure cookies only work over HTTPS
   - Protect data in transit

7. **Implement Account Lockout**:
   - Lock accounts after failed login attempts
   - Require admin intervention or time-based unlock

## Current Use Case

This implementation is suitable for:
- Development and testing
- Internal networks
- Learning and demonstration purposes

For production deployment, please address the limitations listed above.

# Security Considerations

This document outlines security features implemented and known limitations.

## Implemented Security Features

✅ **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage
✅ **Session-based Authentication**: Using express-session with secure cookies in production
✅ **Environment Variable Protection**: SESSION_SECRET must be set in production
✅ **Role-based Access Control**: Middleware enforces proper authorization
✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries throughout
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Implemented for all API routes (100 req/15min) and authentication endpoints (5 req/15min)
✅ **Input Validation**: Using express-validator to validate all user inputs
✅ **Authentication Logging**: All authentication attempts are logged with timestamp, IP, username, and status
✅ **Account Lockout**: Accounts are locked for 30 minutes after 5 failed login attempts

## Known Limitations (For Production Consideration)

⚠️ **CSRF Protection**: Currently not implemented
- **Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks possible
- **Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens (e.g., csurf middleware) for state-changing operations
- **Note**: REST APIs often use other authentication methods (JWT, OAuth) instead of sessions to avoid CSRF

## Security Implementation Details

1. **Rate Limiting** ✅ Implemented:
   - General API limiter: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Authentication limiter: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Protects against DoS and brute force attacks
   ```javascript
   // Applied in src/middleware/rateLimiter.js
   app.use('/api/', apiLimiter);
   router.post('/login', authLimiter, ...);
   router.post('/register', authLimiter, ...);
   ```

2. **Input Validation** ✅ Implemented:
   - Using express-validator for all user inputs
   - Validates email format, username format, password length, etc.
   - Applied to all routes (users, ideas, projects)
   ```javascript
   // See src/middleware/validation.js
   router.post('/register', validateUserRegistration, ...);
   ```

3. **Authentication Logging** ✅ Implemented:
   - Logs all login/register attempts
   - Includes timestamp, IP address, username, and status code
   - Enables monitoring for suspicious patterns
   ```javascript
   // See src/middleware/logger.js
   router.post('/login', logAuthAttempt, ...);
   ```

4. **Account Lockout** ✅ Implemented:
   - Locks account after 5 failed login attempts
   - 30-minute lockout duration
   - Automatic unlock after lockout period expires
   - Database tracks: failed_login_attempts, account_locked_until
   ```javascript
   // See src/middleware/accountLockout.js
   ```

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Add CSRF Protection** (if continuing to use session-based auth):
   ```javascript
   const csrf = require('csurf');
   app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));
   ```

2. **Consider JWT Authentication** instead of sessions for a REST API:
   - Avoids CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Better for scaling across multiple servers
   - More suitable for mobile/SPA clients

3. **Use HTTPS in Production**:
   - Secure cookies only work over HTTPS
   - Protect data in transit
   - Required for the session cookie security settings to be effective

## Current Use Case

This implementation is suitable for:
- Development and testing
- Internal networks
- Learning and demonstration purposes

For production deployment, please address the limitations listed above.
